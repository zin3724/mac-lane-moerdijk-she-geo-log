This is almost exactly the same as the proof of Proposition 1.6.1 on pp. 46-47. Note that $D_B$ is the forgetful functor from $\mathbf C/B$ to $\mathbf C$ that takes each object in $\mathbf C/B$ to its domain.

Suppose $\phi$ is a natural trasformation in $\widehat{\mathbf{C}}(R\times P,Q)$, then we define for each $B\in\obj(\mathbf C)$ the component $\phi'_B$ such that for each $u\in R(B)$, the image $\phi'_B(u)\in\widehat{\mathbf{C}/B}(P_B,Q_B)$ has its component at each $\lt(C\xra{f}B\rt)\in\obj(\mathbf C/B)$, defined by
\[(\phi'_B(u))_f:P(C)\to Q(C):y\mapsto\phi_C(u\cdot f,y)=\phi_C(R(f)(u),y)\]

Now, we define the evaluation map $ev$ from $\widehat{\mathbf{C}/(-)}(P_{(-)},Q_{(-)})\times P$ to $Q$, by defining for each $B\in\obj(\mathbf{C})$, its component as
\[(ev)_B:\widehat{\mathbf{C}/B}(P_B,Q_B)\times P(B)\to Q(B):(\alpha,w)\mapsto\alpha_{1_B}(w)\]
so as an example, for $(u,w)\in R(B)\times P(B)$, we have
\[(ev)_B(\phi'_B(u),w)=(\phi'_B(u))_{1_B}(w)=\phi_B(u\cdot1_B,w)=\phi_B(R(1_B)(u),w)\]
\[=\phi_B(1_{R(B)}(u),w)=\phi_B(u,w)\]
hence each $\phi\in\widehat{\mathbf{C}}(R\times P,Q)$ factors through $ev$. Now, it follows from the way we costructed each $\phi'_B$ and the constraint that $\phi'$ has to be a natural trasformation from $R$ to $\widehat{\mathbf{C}/(-)}(P_{(-)},Q_{(-)})$, that $\phi$ factors uniquely through $ev$, so $\widehat{\mathbf{C}/(-)}(P_{(-)},Q_{(-)})$ can be regarded as the exponential $Q^P$ in $\widehat{\mathbf{C}}$.
